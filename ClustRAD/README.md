### ClustRAD Pipeline

This folder contains scripts for 

* Making restriction enzyme (SbFI/MseI) cut site clusters (`./insilico_digest/`)
* Filtering clusters to get BED intervals (SbFI <=> MseI) based on coverage in BAMs and length (`./filter`)

Please read the individual README.md files in those folders
