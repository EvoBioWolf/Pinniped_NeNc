This folders contains the scripts used to extract the CDS from the two otarrid genomes (Arctocephalus gazella and Zalophus californianus), for which no annotation was available and to obtain dN/dS estimates from coding sequences.
Script 1 extracts the coordinates from the blast output.
Script 2 extracts the sequences from scaffolds.
Script 3 Builds the alignments for the 5 pinnipeds (Odobenus, Neomonachus, Leptonychotes, Arctocephalus, Zalophus) + 2 outgroups (Canis, Ailuropoda).

Alignment with macse was performed using the following command line:

java -jar macse -gap_op -gap_ext_ratio

where the -gap op and -gap_ext_ratio allows for lower costs of gap introduction and extension. 

script 4 removes codons with gaps in more than half of the sequences.
script 5 removes misaligned regions using HMMcleaner.

Substitution mapping was performed using the bppml and mapnh programs available at
https://github.com/BioPP/bppsuite/releases/tag/v2.3.2 and https://github.com/BioPP/testnh/releases, respectively. Otherwise, pre-installation of the Bio++ libraries is required for compilation.

bppml (source code available at https://github.com/BioPP/bppsuite) performs branch-length and parameter optimisation for each alignment.
mapnh (source code available at https://github.com/BioPP/testnh/) maps and counts non-synonymous and synonymous substitutions for each alignment using the optimised values from previous step.

As an output, non-synonymous and synonymous counts (N and S) as well as the number of non-synonymous and synonymous sites are obtained for each alignment and averaged for each species in order to obtain global estimates.
